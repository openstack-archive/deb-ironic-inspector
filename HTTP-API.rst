HTTP API
--------

By default **ironic-inspector** listens on ``0.0.0.0:5050``, port
can be changed in configuration. Protocol is JSON over HTTP.

Start Introspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``POST /v1/introspection/<UUID>`` initiate hardware introspection for node
``<UUID>``. All power management configuration for this node needs to be done
prior to calling the endpoint (except when `Setting IPMI Credentials`_).

Requires X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for authentication.

Optional parameters:

* ``new_ipmi_password`` if set, **ironic-inspector** will try to set IPMI
  password on the machine to this value. Power credentials validation will be
  skipped and manual power on will be required. See `Setting IPMI
  credentials`_ for details.

* ``new_ipmi_username`` provides new IPMI user name in addition to password
  set by ``new_ipmi_password``. Defaults to current ``ipmi_username`` in
  node ``driver_info`` field.

Response:

* 202 - accepted introspection request
* 400 - bad request
* 401, 403 - missing or invalid authentication
* 404 - node cannot be found

Get Introspection Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``GET /v1/introspection/<UUID>`` get hardware introspection status.

Requires X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for authentication.

Response:

* 200 - OK
* 400 - bad request
* 401, 403 - missing or invalid authentication
* 404 - node cannot be found

Response body: JSON dictionary with keys:

* ``finished`` (boolean) whether introspection is finished
* ``error`` error string or ``null``

Get Introspection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``GET /v1/introspection/<UUID>/data`` get stored data from successful
introspection.

Requires X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for authentication.

Response:

* 200 - OK
* 400 - bad request
* 401, 403 - missing or invalid authentication
* 404 - data cannot be found or data storage not configured

Response body: JSON dictionary with introspection data

Introspection Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `Introspection Rules documentation`_ for details.

All these API endpoints require X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for
authentication.

* ``POST /v1/rules`` create a new introspection rule.

  Request body: JSON dictionary with keys:

  * ``conditions`` rule conditions, see `Introspection Rules documentation`_
  * ``actions`` rule actions, see `Introspection Rules documentation`_
  * ``description`` (optional) human-readable description
  * ``uuid`` (optional) rule UUID, autogenerated if missing

  Response

  * 200 - OK
  * 400 - bad request

  Response body: JSON dictionary with introspection rule representation (the
  same as above with UUID filled in).

* ``GET /v1/rules`` list all introspection rules.

  Response

  * 200 - OK

  Response body: JSON dictionary with key ``rules`` - list of short rule
  representations. Short rule representation is a JSON dictionary with keys:

  * ``uuid`` rule UUID
  * ``description`` human-readable description
  * ``links`` list of HTTP links, use one with ``rel=self`` to get the full
    rule details

* ``DELETE /v1/rules`` delete all introspection rules.

  Response

  * 204 - OK

* ``GET /v1/rules/<UUID>`` get one introspection rule by its ``<UUID>``.

  Response

  * 200 - OK
  * 404 - not found

  Response body: JSON dictionary with introspection rule representation
  (see ``POST /v1/rules`` above).

* ``DELETE /v1/rules/<UUID>`` delete one introspection rule by its ``<UUID>``.

  Response

  * 204 - OK
  * 404 - not found

Ramdisk Callback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``POST /v1/continue`` internal endpoint for the ramdisk to post back
discovered data. Should not be used for anything other than implementing
the ramdisk. Request body: JSON dictionary with at least these keys:

* ``cpus`` number of CPU
* ``cpu_arch`` architecture of the CPU
* ``memory_mb`` RAM in MiB
* ``local_gb`` hard drive size in GiB
* ``interfaces`` dictionary filled with data from all NIC's, keys being
  interface names, values being dictionaries with keys:

  * ``mac`` MAC address
  * ``ip`` IP address

* ``ipmi_address`` IP address of BMC, may be missing on VM
* ``boot_interface`` optional MAC address of the NIC that the machine
  PXE booted from either in standard format ``11:22:33:44:55:66`` or
  in *PXELinux* ``BOOTIF`` format ``01-11-22-33-44-55-66``.

* ``error`` optional error happened during ramdisk run, interpreted by
  ``ramdisk_error`` plugin

* ``logs`` optional base64-encoded logs from the ramdisk

* ``block_devices`` optional block devices information for
  ``root_device_hint`` plugin, dictionary with keys:

  * ``serials`` list of serial numbers of block devices.

.. note::
      This list highly depends on enabled plugins, provided above are
      expected keys for the default set of plugins. See Plugins_ for details.

.. note::
    This endpoint is not expected to be versioned, though versioning will work
    on it.

Response:

* 200 - OK
* 400 - bad request
* 403 - node is not on introspection
* 404 - node cannot be found or multiple nodes found

Response body: JSON dictionary. If `Setting IPMI Credentials`_ is requested,
body will contain the following keys:

* ``ipmi_setup_credentials`` boolean ``True``
* ``ipmi_username`` new IPMI user name
* ``ipmi_password`` new IPMI password

Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an error happens during request processing, **Ironic Inspector** returns
a response with an appropriate HTTP code set, e.g. 400 for bad request or
404 when something was not found (usually node in cache or node in ironic).
The following JSON body is returned::

    {
        "error": {
            "message": "Full error message"
        }
    }

This body may be extended in the future to include details that are more error
specific.

API Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API supports optional API versioning. You can query for minimum and
maximum API version supported by the server. You can also declare required API
version in your requests, so that the server rejects request of unsupported
version.

.. note::
    Versioning was introduced in **Ironic Inspector 2.1.0**.

All versions must be supplied as string in form of ``X.Y``, where ``X`` is a
major version and is always ``1`` for now, ``Y`` is a minor version.

* If ``X-OpenStack-Ironic-Inspector-API-Version`` header is sent with request,
  the server will check if it supports this version. HTTP error 406 will be
  returned for unsupported API version.

* All HTTP responses contain
  ``X-OpenStack-Ironic-Inspector-API-Minimum-Version`` and
  ``X-OpenStack-Ironic-Inspector-API-Maximum-Version`` headers with minimum
  and maximum API versions supported by the server.

API Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API supports API discovery. You can query different parts of the API to
discover what other endpoints are avaliable.

* ``GET /`` List API Versions

  Response:

  * 200 - OK

  Response body: JSON dictionary containing a list of ``versions``, each
  version contains:

  * ``status`` Either CURRENT or SUPPORTED
  * ``id`` The version identifier
  * ``links`` A list of links to this version endpoint containing:

    * ``href`` The URL
    * ``rel`` The relationship between the version and the href

* ``GET /v1`` List API v1 resources

  Response:

  * 200 - OK

  Response body: JSON dictionary containing a list of ``resources``, each
  resource contains:

  * ``name`` The name of this resources
  * ``links`` A list of link to this resource containing:

    * ``href`` The URL
    * ``rel`` The relationship between the resource and the href

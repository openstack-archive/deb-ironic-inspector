fixes:
  - The ramdisk logs are now stored on all preprocessing errors, not only
    ones reported by the ramdisk itself. This required moving the ramdisk
    logs handling from the "ramdisk_error" plugin to the generic processing
    code.
upgrade:
  - Handling ramdisk logs was moved out of the "ramdisk_error" plugin, so
    disabling it will no longer disable handling ramdisk logs. As before,
    you can set "ramdisk_logs_dir" option to an empty value (the default)
    to disable storing ramdisk logs.

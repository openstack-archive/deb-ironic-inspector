upgrade:
  - API "POST /v1/rules" returns 201 response code instead of
    200 on creating success. API version was bumped to 1.6.
    API less than 1.6 continues to return 200.
  - Default API version was changed from minimum to maximum
    which Inspector can support.
fixes:
  - Fix response return code for rule creating endpoint, it
    returns 201 now instead of 200 on success.

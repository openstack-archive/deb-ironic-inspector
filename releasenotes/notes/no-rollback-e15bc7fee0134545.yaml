upgrade:
  - Introspection rules actions 'set-attribute', 'set-capability' and
    'extend-attribute' no longer have the opposite effect on nodes that do not
    match a rule.
fixes:
  - Dropped rollback actions from 'set-attribute', 'set-capability' and
    'extend-attribute' introspection rules actions, as they were confusing,
    completely undocumented and broke some real world use cases
    (e.g. setting driver field).

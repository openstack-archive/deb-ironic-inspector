prelude: >
    Starting with this release, ironic-python-agent becomes the default
    introspection ramdisk, with the old bash-based ramdisk being deprecated.
features:
  - Inspector no longer requires old-style "local_gb", "memory_mb", "cpus"
    and "cpu_arch" fields from the introspection ramdisk. They are still
    supported, though, for compatibility with the old ramdisk.
upgrade:
  - The root_disk_selection processing hook will now error out if root device
    hints are specified on ironic node, but ironic-python-agent is not used
    as an introspection ramdisk.
deprecations:
  - Using old bash-based ramdisk is deprecated, please switch to
    ironic-python-agent as soon as possible.

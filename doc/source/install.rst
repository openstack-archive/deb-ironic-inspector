Installation
------------

Install from PyPI_ (you may want to use virtualenv to isolate your
environment)::

    pip install ironic-inspector

Also there is a `DevStack <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/>`_
plugin for **ironic-inspector** - see :ref:`contributing_link` for the current
status.

Finally, some distributions (e.g. Fedora) provide **ironic-inspector**
packaged, some of them - under its old name *ironic-discoverd*.

There are several projects you can use to set up **ironic-inspector** in
production. `puppet-ironic
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/puppet-ironic/>`_ provides Puppet
manifests, while `bifrost <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/bifrost/>`_
provides an Ansible-based standalone installer. Refer to Configuration_
if you plan on installing **ironic-inspector** manually.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ironic-inspector

Note for Ubuntu users
  Please beware :ref:`possible DNS issues <ubuntu-dns>` when installing
  Ironic-Inspector on Ubuntu.

Version Support Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**ironic-inspector** currently requires bare metal API version ``1.11`` to be
provided by Ironic. This version is available starting with Ironic Liberty
release.

Here is a mapping between Ironic versions and supported **ironic-inspector**
versions. The Standalone column shows which **ironic-inspector** versions can
be used in standalone mode with each Ironic version. The Inspection Interface
column shows which **ironic-inspector** versions can be used with the Ironic
inspection interface in each version of Ironic.

============== ========== ====================
Ironic Version Standalone Inspection Interface
============== ========== ====================
Juno           1.0        N/A
Kilo           1.0 - 2.2  1.0 - 1.1
Liberty        1.1 - 2.X  2.0 - 2.X
Mitaka+        2.0 - 2.X  2.0 - 2.X
============== ========== ====================

.. note::
    ``2.X`` means we don't have specific plans on deprecating support for this
    Ironic version. This does not imply that we'll support it forever though.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy ``example.conf`` to some permanent place
(e.g. ``/etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf``).
Fill in at least these configuration values:

* The ``keystone_authtoken`` section - credentials to use when checking user
  authentication.

* The ``ironic`` section - credentials to use when accessing the Ironic API.

* ``connection`` in the ``database`` section - SQLAlchemy connection string
  for the database;

* ``dnsmasq_interface`` - interface on which ``dnsmasq`` (or another DHCP
  service) listens for PXE boot requests (defaults to ``br-ctlplane`` which is
  a sane default for TripleO-based installations but is unlikely to work for
  other cases).

See comments inside `example.conf
<https://github.com/openstack/ironic-inspector/blob/master/example.conf>`_
for the other possible configuration options.

.. note::
    Configuration file contains a password and thus should be owned by ``root``
    and should have access rights like ``0600``.

Here is an example *inspector.conf* (adapted from a gate run)::

    [DEFAULT]
    debug = false
    rootwrap_config = /etc/ironic-inspector/rootwrap.conf

    [database]
    connection = mysql+pymysql://root:<PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1/ironic_inspector?charset=utf8

    [firewall]
    dnsmasq_interface = br-ctlplane

    [ironic]
    os_region = RegionOne
    project_name = service
    password = <PASSWORD>
    username = ironic-inspector
    auth_url = http://127.0.0.1/identity
    auth_type = password

    [keystone_authtoken]
    auth_uri = http://127.0.0.1/identity
    project_name = service
    password = <PASSWORD>
    username = ironic-inspector
    auth_url = http://127.0.0.1/identity_v2_admin
    auth_type = password

    [processing]
    ramdisk_logs_dir = /var/log/ironic-inspector/ramdisk
    store_data = swift

    [swift]
    os_region = RegionOne
    project_name = service
    password = <PASSWORD>
    username = ironic-inspector
    auth_url = http://127.0.0.1/identity
    auth_type = password

.. note::
    Set ``debug = true`` if you want to see complete logs.

**ironic-inspector** requires root rights for managing iptables. It gets them
by running ``ironic-inspector-rootwrap`` utility with ``sudo``.
To allow it, copy file ``rootwrap.conf`` and directory ``rootwrap.d`` to the
configuration directory (e.g. ``/etc/ironic-inspector/``) and create file
``/etc/sudoers.d/ironic-inspector-rootwrap`` with the following content::

   stack ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ironic-inspector-rootwrap /etc/ironic-inspector/rootwrap.conf *

.. DANGER::
   Be very careful about typos in ``/etc/sudoers.d/ironic-inspector-rootwrap``
   as any typo will break sudo for **ALL** users on the system. Especially,
   make sure there is a new line at the end of this file.

.. note::
    ``rootwrap.conf`` and all files in ``rootwrap.d`` must be writeable
    only by root.

.. note::
    If you store ``rootwrap.d`` in a different location, make sure to update
    the *filters_path* option in ``rootwrap.conf`` to reflect the change.

    If your ``rootwrap.conf`` is in a different location, then you need
    to update the *rootwrap_config* option in ``ironic-inspector.conf``
    to point to that location.

Replace ``stack`` with whatever user you'll be using to run
**ironic-inspector**.

Configuring IPA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ironic-python-agent_ is a ramdisk developed for Ironic. During the Liberty
cycle support for **ironic-inspector** was added. This is the default ramdisk
starting with the Mitaka release.

.. note::
    You need at least 1.5 GiB of RAM on the machines to use IPA built with
    diskimage-builder_ and at least 384 MiB to use the *TinyIPA*.

To build an ironic-python-agent ramdisk, do the following:

* Get the new enough version of diskimage-builder_::

    sudo pip install -U "diskimage-builder>=1.1.2"

* Build the ramdisk::

    disk-image-create ironic-agent fedora -o ironic-agent

  .. note::
    Replace "fedora" with your distribution of choice.

* Use the resulting files ``ironic-agent.kernel`` and
  ``ironic-agent.initramfs`` in the following instructions to set PXE or iPXE.

Alternatively, you can download a `prebuilt TinyIPA image
<http://tarballs.openstack.org/ironic-python-agent/tinyipa/files/>`_ or use
the `other builders
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic-python-agent/#image-builders>`_.

.. _ironic-python-agent: https://github.com/openstack/ironic-python-agent

Configuring PXE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As for PXE boot environment, you'll need:

* TFTP server running and accessible (see below for using *dnsmasq*).
  Ensure ``pxelinux.0`` is present in the TFTP root.

  Copy ``ironic-agent.kernel`` and ``ironic-agent.initramfs`` to the TFTP
  root as well.

* Next, set up ``$TFTPROOT/pxelinux.cfg/default`` as follows::

    default introspect

    label introspect
    kernel ironic-agent.kernel
    append initrd=ironic-agent.initramfs ipa-inspection-callback-url=http://{IP}:5050/v1/continue systemd.journald.forward_to_console=yes

    ipappend 3

  Replace ``{IP}`` with IP of the machine (do not use loopback interface, it
  will be accessed by ramdisk on a booting machine).

  .. note::
     While ``systemd.journald.forward_to_console=yes`` is not actually
     required, it will substantially simplify debugging if something
     goes wrong. You can also enable IPA debug logging by appending
     ``ipa-debug=1``.

  IPA is pluggable: you can insert introspection plugins called
  *collectors* into it. For example, to enable a very handy ``logs`` collector
  (sending ramdisk logs to **ironic-inspector**), modify the ``append`` line in
  ``$TFTPROOT/pxelinux.cfg/default``::

    append initrd=ironic-agent.initramfs ipa-inspection-callback-url=http://{IP}:5050/v1/continue ipa-inspection-collectors=default,logs systemd.journald.forward_to_console=yes

  .. note::
     You probably want to always keep the ``default`` collector, as it provides
     the basic information required for introspection.

* You need PXE boot server (e.g. *dnsmasq*) running on **the same** machine as
  **ironic-inspector**. Don't do any firewall configuration:
  **ironic-inspector** will handle it for you. In the **ironic-inspector**
  configuration file set ``dnsmasq_interface`` to the interface your
  PXE boot server listens on. Here is an example *dnsmasq.conf*::

    port=0
    interface={INTERFACE}
    bind-interfaces
    dhcp-range={DHCP IP RANGE, e.g. 192.168.0.50,192.168.0.150}
    enable-tftp
    tftp-root={TFTP ROOT, e.g. /tftpboot}
    dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0
    dhcp-sequential-ip

  .. note::
    ``dhcp-sequential-ip`` is used because otherwise a lot of nodes booting
    simultaneously cause conflicts - the same IP address is suggested to
    several nodes.

Configuring iPXE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

iPXE allows better scaling as it primarily uses the HTTP protocol instead of
slow and unreliable TFTP. You still need a TFTP server as a fall back for
nodes not supporting iPXE. To use iPXE you'll need:

* TFTP server running and accessible (see above for using *dnsmasq*).
  Ensure ``undionly.kpxe`` is present in the TFTP root. If any of your nodes
  boot with UEFI, you'll also need ``ipxe.efi`` there.

* You also need an HTTP server capable of serving static files.
  Copy ``ironic-agent.kernel`` and ``ironic-agent.initramfs`` there.

* Create a file called ``inspector.ipxe`` in the HTTP root (you can name and
  place it differently, just don't forget to adjust the *dnsmasq.conf* example
  below)::

    #!ipxe

    :retry_dhcp
    dhcp || goto retry_dhcp

    :retry_boot
    imgfree
    kernel --timeout 30000 http://{IP}:8088/ironic-agent.kernel ipa-inspection-callback-url=http://{IP}>:5050/v1/continue systemd.journald.forward_to_console=yes BOOTIF=${mac} initrd=agent.ramdisk || goto retry_boot
    initrd --timeout 30000 http://{IP}:8088/ironic-agent.ramdisk || goto retry_boot
    boot

  .. note::
     Older versions of the iPXE ROM tend to misbehave on unreliable network
     connection, thus we use the timeout option with retries.

  Just like with PXE you can customize the list of collectors by appending
  the ``ipa-inspector-collectors`` kernel option, for example::

    ipa-inspection-collectors=default,logs,extra_hardware

* Just as with PXE you'll need a PXE boot server. The configuration, however,
  will be different. Here is an example *dnsmasq.conf*::

    port=0
    interface={INTERFACE}
    bind-interfaces
    dhcp-range={DHCP IP RANGE, e.g. 192.168.0.50,192.168.0.150}
    enable-tftp
    tftp-root={TFTP ROOT, e.g. /tftpboot}
    dhcp-sequential-ip
    dhcp-match=ipxe,175
    dhcp-match=set:efi,option:client-arch,7
    dhcp-boot=tag:ipxe,http://{IP}:8088/inspector.ipxe
    dhcp-boot=tag:efi,ipxe.efi
    dhcp-boot=undionly.kpxe,localhost.localdomain,{IP}

  First, we configure the same common parameters as with PXE. Then we define
  ``ipxe`` and ``efi`` tags. Nodes already supporting iPXE are ordered to
  download and execute ``inspector.ipxe``. Nodes without iPXE booted with UEFI
  will get ``ipxe.efi`` firmware to execute, while the remaining will get
  ``undionly.kpxe``.

Managing the **ironic-inspector** database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**ironic-inspector** provides a command line client for managing its database,
this client can be used for upgrading, and downgrading the database using
alembic migrations.

If this is your first time running **ironic-inspector** to migrate the
database simply run:
::

    ironic-inspector-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf upgrade

If you have previously run a version of **ironic-inspector** earlier than
2.2.0, the safest thing is to delete the existing SQLite database and run
``upgrade`` as shown above. If you, however, want to save the existing
database, to ensure your database will work with the migrations, you'll need to
run an extra step before upgrading the database. You only need to do this the
first time running version 2.2.0 or later.

If you are upgrading from **ironic-inspector** version 2.1.0 or lower:
::

    ironic-inspector-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf stamp --revision 578f84f38d
    ironic-inspector-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf upgrade

If you are upgrading from a git master install of **ironic-inspector** from
after :ref:`rules` were introduced:
::

    ironic-inspector-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf stamp --revision d588418040d
    ironic-inspector-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf upgrade

Other available commands can be discovered by running::

    ironic-inspector-dbsync --help

Running
~~~~~~~

::

    ironic-inspector --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf

A good starting point for writing your own *systemd* unit should be `one used
in Fedora <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openstack-ironic-discoverd.git/plain/openstack-ironic-discoverd.service>`_
(note usage of old name).
